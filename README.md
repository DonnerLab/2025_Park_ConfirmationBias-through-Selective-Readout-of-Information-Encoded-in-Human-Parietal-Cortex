MATLAB codes used to compute information measures and behavioral metrics in article: <link to paper, DOI>
MATLAB version: MATLAB2020b, MATLAB2024

The Figure indices corresponding to figures in the manuscript are included in the script name.
Script Figure3_confbias_BM*.m can be used to also plot brain maps in Figures S7, S12.
Script Figure4_*.m plots for main Figure4, and also Supplementary Figures S8, S9 and S10. 
The source data for plotting the figures (i.e., PCA component neural data for all participants, 
aggregated information measures for all cortical parcels and all participants: gFTII_*.mat, gFTMI_*.mat, behavioral data, regression coefficient data) 
can be found here at the University of Hamburg Center for Sustainable Data Management: https://doi.org/10.25592/uhhfdm.16918

plot_maps folder contains the necessary data and code for plotting brain maps with 180 cortical parcels, with the Glasser atlas (Glasser et al. A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex, Nature. 2016 Aug 11;536(7615):171–178. doi: 10.1038/nature18933)


Computation of the information measures which are central to this project was done with the MINT:

Scripts which compute the information measures using MINT with source data (principal components:
  Intersection information: confbias_MINTII_int12_cic.m 
  Mutual information: confbias_MINTMI_int12_SE.m

Script which computes the intersection information linear proxy, corr(s^hat, E) in Figure S11:
  confbias_regress_sample_int12_cic.m
